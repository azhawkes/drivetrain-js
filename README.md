# drivetrain.js

Drivetrain is a simple HTTP testing and validation library for Node.

It's a simple, easy way to chain together sequential HTTP requests and validate the responses. 

Drivetrain is especially ideal for testing RESTful services. It's also a lightweight alternative to Selenium or PhantomJS 
because it speaks plain old HTTP and doesn't require spinning up a headless web browser.

More documentation is coming soon! In the meantime, check out the **examples** directory.
