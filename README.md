# drivetrain.js

Drivetrain is a simple HTTP automation library for Node.

It's a simple, easy way to chain together sequential HTTP requests and validate the responses. 

Drivetrain's sweet spot is testing RESTful services with JSON or XML, but it doesn't stop there. It's also a lightweight alternative to Selenium or PhantomJS because it speaks plain old HTTP and doesn't require spinning up a headless web browser.

More documentation is coming soon! In the meantime, check out the **examples** directory.
